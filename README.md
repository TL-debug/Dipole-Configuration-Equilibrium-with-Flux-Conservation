DEGS (Dipole Equilibrium Grad-Shafranov Solver) is a computational code designed for solving free-boundary equilibrium problems. This solver is applicable to equilibrium configurations involving dipole fields generated by both supported dipole coils and levitated dipole coils. It is specifically tailored to accommodate two key physical constraints during plasma discharges with a levitated superconducting coil: the conservation of magnetic flux through the levitated coil, and the balance between the gravitational force and the supporting force acting on it. DEGS can be used for both forward equilibrium and inverse calculations (equilibrium reconstruction). DEGS is compatible with MATLAB R2021a and later versions. The following system configuration is recommended for optimal performance: CPU: Intel Core i7 10th generation or equivalent; RAM: 16GB or higher. For details regarding the algorithms and implementation of the code, please refer to the associated preprint or any subsequently published papers. The code is released under the MIT License.
